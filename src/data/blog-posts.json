    "body": "Embark on a picturesque journey westward from Seattle, and you'll discover the captivating charm of Neah Bay, nestled in the northwestern corner of the United States. This scenic drive is well worth undertaking, for it leads to a fishing haven unlike any other in the Lower 48. Moreover, if you have a penchant for diving, Neah Bay promises an awe-inspiring spectacle beneath its azure waters. While free diving presents a more convenient option, scuba diving is also available for those seeking an immersive experience. The primary objective of our expedition was to engage in free diving and spearfishing, and despite less-than-ideal tidal conditions, we successfully located vibrant schools of Black Rockfish. As expected in the Northwest, the weather showcased its typical mélange of rain, sunshine, and wind gusts. Should you ever find yourself with the opportunity to fish in Neah Bay, I implore you to seize it without hesitation!",

    "timestamp": 1538352000000,
    "body": "A grueling 11 hour climb up Navajo Peak was how I spent my Saturday.  We woke up at 4:30am and arrived at the trailhead by 6:15am.  The timer started and we set out at 6:30am.  Round trip the climb was about 11 miles with 2900 ft of elevation gain.  Luckily all the elevation gain is in the last 2 miles…  The route follows the Isabelle Glacier trail until it ends, where you must route find up Airplane Gully to the ridge and finally up the last bit to the summit.  Airplane Gully, aka, the “ankle breaker” has plane wreckage scattered throughout.  In 1948 a C-47 plane leaving Denver lost control in high winds and crashed into a cliff near the summit of Navajo Peak. Seeing the wreckage up close was eye opening, thrilling, and sad.  The three people in the plane were not found for months due to the harsh winter.  The debris made for some interesting subjects to photograph in the high alpine.  I would highly recommend this climb for anyone willing to endure it. Watch a short video of our summit below. ",

It's pretty much always an adventure hanging out with Kendra and Brandon and this trip did not disappoint!   The colors in Mexico were so vivid and deep, something you don't see in Colorado, which gave the wedding a very warm feel.  The wedding was a public display which added another element of interesting viewers in the background.  Enjoy!",

    "body": "It started with a last minute idea from a friend to travel to Alaska for New Years to see the northern lights.  We took a direct flight from Denver to Anchorage and a two hour drive to Talkeetna on the day after Christmas 2017.  The weather couldn't have been better!  Clear skies in the winter are almost unheard of and although the aurora display wasn't off the charts, it was still visible and beautiful.  It started with a last minute idea from a friend to travel to Alaska for New Years to see the northern lights.  We took a direct flight from Denver to Anchorage and a two hour drive to Talkeetna on the day after Christmas 2017.  The weather couldn't have been better!  Clear skies in the winter are almost unheard of and although the aurora display wasn't off the charts, it was still visible and beautiful.  With such nice weather we decided to take a scenic flight tour over the Alaskan Range with K2 Aviation in Talkeetna.  Being so close yet so far from those mountains was incredible.  The sheer scale is impressive when you get up close.  Scattered clouds and some alpine glow really gave the mountain some depth.  Denali itself was still 10,000 ft above our heads during the flight and was a little tough to photograph.  Although the cliffs and glaciers surrounding Denali were just as, if not more, impressive.  While in Anchorage, we decided to take a scenic two hour drive to the Matanuska Glacier. In the winter, this active glacier is only accessible through a guided tour. We were lucky enough to sign up and get the opportunity to tour the glacier. Our guide was very knowledgeable and taught us how glaciers were formed and took us inside crevasses. The Matanuska Glacier is 24 miles long and 4 miles wide at the terminus, averaging approximately 2 miles in width. It is a remarkable site to see!  The next adventure to Alaska will hopefully be spent underwater!",
