        "paragraph": "While pretending to be a tourist in my local stomping grounds, I came across some beautiful Gyotaku prints of kelp at a local art store in Port Angeles, Washington. My uncle, visiting at the time, kindly bought some of this artwork and gifted it to me. Little did I know, I would soon become friends with the artist himself. Nam Sui, also known as @Spearotaku on Instagram, is a local spearo and biologist. Nam creates beautiful Gyotuaku prints from fish and other marine creatures and has a unique style and method. "

Together, the blueprint was laid for an epic diving expedition. The plan was to spend the day free diving for lingcod and rockfish and document the entire Gyotaku printing process from the spear to print."

        "paragraph": "The tides favored the afternoon, so we met at the boat launch at 10:00 a.m. All being diving aficionados, friendly smiles and fishing stories were exchanged at the boat launch. After packing our gear, making a dive plan, and launching the boat, we set off. The Pacific Northwest offers an infinite number of dive sites, but we had a specific secret site in mind. According to legend, lingcods love shipwrecks, so that's where we were headed. Campbell graciously took us out on his boat, which was perfect for spearfishing being a small inflatable rib."

        "paragraph": "Before long, the landscape seamlessly transitioned from idyllic shores to the majestic waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, bathed in the resplendent hues of a summer sun. After a short 15-minute run, we reached our submerged sanctuary, yet the currents were unrelenting, fiercely guarding our treasure trove. At this spot, a shallow reef, a finger of land thrusting seaward, catalyzed turbulence of upwelling currents. Conditions seemed daunting and a contemplative huddle led to an alternative plan – to dive into a kelp-shrouded nook, both a location to warm the lungs and a staging area for taming the currents' ferocity."

        "paragraph": "Diving closer in kelp slows down the current, but it also decreases visibility. Diving is still possible, but it's not as favorable for photography. Campbell, Nam, and I all speared a few Black Rockfish, so we were already guaranteed prints and dinner. After about half an hour, we decided it was time to check our secret dive site. Unfortunately, our anchor was stuck. Campbell and I had found this anchor on another shipwreck near Seattle. It was a great find, but little did we know the anchor was down there for a reason – it was too effective. This Bruce-style anchor hooks onto things and doesn't let go. Fortunately, we are divers and could retrieve it manually.T the previous crew who owned it were not divers. Nam made a few dives and managed to unhook it."

        "paragraph": "As we motored to our next dive site, the strong surface current was still evident. Nonetheless, we decided to anchor and wait it out. Nam dipped his fins into the water, and they bent like a banana, indicating the strong current. While sharing stories, we waited for about an hour, and finally, the tide started to slack off, allowing us to get in for our dives. Nam did a few dives to locate the exact site, and we were about 50 feet away from our desired destination. We attempted to pull up the anchor and relocate, but the mighty Bruce was stuck again. Nam had to make five dives to free it. We moved 50 feet closer, anchored again, and decided we might need a floating line off the stern in case we drifted away, but we didn't have a buoy. I decided to empty out all my fresh water and use my water bottle as a buoy, which turned out to be a bad idea."

        "id": 18,
        "paragraph": "The site turned out to be incredible, with habitat and wreckage scattered everywhere. Visibility was around 25 feet, and the reduced current made conditions more manageable. As the current slowed down, the rockfish and lingcod emerged from their hiding spots to feed, revealing themselves to us. About halfway through our dive session, Nam spotted a bright orange boat in the distance – a Coast Guard vessel. Not that we were doing anything wrong, but we had lost our dive flag earlier that day, so technically, we were in the wrong. They inspected our boat but didn't mention anything about the missing dive flag, luckily for us."

        "paragraph": "Nam had the best luck that day, spearing a nice-sized lingcod and possibly a state-record black rockfish using a speargun. Campbell came in second with a few good rockfish, and I came in third – but that's only because I was the one taking photos! I did have a battle with a nice lingcod but lost it. I speared the lingcod, which then darted into the wreckage, tangling my line around rocks and steel rubble. I had to make a second dive to release the line from the gun and a third dive to retrieve the fish from within the rubble. The fish slipped off my spear on the way up, glanced at me, and winked. At that moment, both my legs began to cramp, and I could barely swim back to the boat. I was dehydrated from repurposing my water bottle as a buoy."

        "paragraph": "As the day grew late, we decided to head back to the ramp to have more time for Gyotaku fish prints. We stopped at the fillet station and cleaned the few fish we weren't going to print. Nam weighed his large rockfish, and it came in at 5.8 pounds. The current state record was 5.51 pounds."
      },

        "id": 21,
        "paragraph": "After cleaning the boat, gear, and stinky wetsuits, we arrived at our campsite. Now it was time to start the Gyotaku prints. Nam's style is very unique – he uses a signature black cloth with white ink. This combination creates a beautiful, vivid, and three-dimensional print. We placed the lingcod and large black rockfish on a table and secured them in position with towels. Nam then carefully applied a thin layer of white ink to every inch of the fish using a roller, resulting in a smoother application that brought out more detail. Once the fish was entirely coated in white ink, he removed a small amount from the eye. Next, he placed the black fabric over the fish and pressed it gently with his hands, ensuring intimate contact. Finally, it was time for the reveal. Slowly pulling the fabric away, the print came to life. After repeating this process several times for each fish, Nam completed four prints. The finishing touches included hand-painting the eye and stamping his name and logo."
      },
      {
        "id": 22,
        "paragraph": "The prints looked incredible – they showcased the most detail Nam had ever achieved in a Gyotaku print. He generously gifted them to Campbell and me. The entire journey, from venturing out to dive in the cold waters of the Pacific Northwest, to spearing fish living on a shipwreck, to creating art, and finally enjoying a fresh fish dinner, was a day to remember."

This scenic drive is well worth undertaking, for it leads to a fishing haven unlike any other in the Lower 48. Moreover, if you have a penchant for diving, Neah Bay promises an awe-inspiring spectacle beneath its azure waters. While free diving presents a more convenient option, scuba diving is also available for those seeking an immersive experience. The primary objective of our expedition was to engage in free diving and spearfishing, and despite less-than-ideal tidal conditions, we successfully located vibrant schools of Black Rockfish. As expected in the Northwest, the weather showcased its typical mélange of rain, sunshine, and wind gusts. Should you ever find yourself with the opportunity to fish in Neah Bay, I implore you to seize it without hesitation!"

        "paragraph": "A grueling 11 hour climb up Navajo Peak was how I spent my Saturday.  We woke up at 4:30am and arrived at the trailhead by 6:15am.  The timer started and we set out at 6:30am.  Round trip the climb was about 11 miles with 2900 ft of elevation gain.  Luckily all the elevation gain is in the last 2 miles…  The route follows the Isabelle Glacier trail until it ends, where you must route find up Airplane Gully to the ridge and finally up the last bit to the summit.  Airplane Gully, aka, the “ankle breaker” has plane wreckage scattered throughout.  In 1948 a C-47 plane leaving Denver lost control in high winds and crashed into a cliff near the summit of Navajo Peak. Seeing the wreckage up close was eye opening, thrilling, and sad.  The three people in the plane were not found for months due to the harsh winter.  The debris made for some interesting subjects to photograph in the high alpine.  I would highly recommend this climb for anyone willing to endure it. Watch a short video of our summit below. "

It's pretty much always an adventure hanging out with Kendra and Brandon and this trip did not disappoint!   The colors in Mexico were so vivid and deep, something you don't see in Colorado, which gave the wedding a very warm feel.  The wedding was a public display which added another element of interesting viewers in the background.  Enjoy!"

        "paragraph": "It started with a last minute idea from a friend to travel to Alaska for New Years to see the northern lights. We took a direct flight from Denver to Anchorage and a two hour drive to Talkeetna on the day after Christmas 2017. The weather couldn't have been better! Clear skies in the winter are almost unheard of and although the aurora display wasn't off the charts, it was still visible and beautiful. With such nice weather we decided to take a scenic flight tour over the Alaskan Range with K2 Aviation in Talkeetna. Being so close yet so far from those mountains was incredible. The sheer scale is impressive when you get up close. Scattered clouds and some alpine glow really gave the mountain some depth. Denali itself was still 10,000 ft above our heads during the flight and was a little tough to photograph. Although the cliffs and glaciers surrounding Denali were just as, if not more, impressive. While in Anchorage, we decided to take a scenic two hour drive to the Matanuska Glacier. In the winter, this active glacier is only accessible through a guided tour. We were lucky enough to sign up and get the opportunity to tour the glacier. Our guide was very knowledgeable and taught us how glaciers were formed and took us inside crevasses. The Matanuska Glacier is 24 miles long and 4 miles wide at the terminus, averaging approximately 2 miles in width. It is a remarkable site to see! The next adventure to Alaska will hopefully be spent underwater!"

Designed to shoot medium format 620 film, which is approximately 6cmx6cm, the camera is a TLR design (twin reflex lens). The top lens is designed for the viewfinder only while the bottom lens exposes the film.  The best part about this camera is the waist level viewfinder! This design makes it difficult to compose as the viewfinder projects the image in reverse but being so large makes it fun.  The Images below are from my first roll of b+w 125ISO film.  Images with snow in the background have the highlights blown out as the camera shutter speed is set around 1/50sec and cannot be changed.  The aperture is also set to f/11 with no other adjustments. That being said, the film speed and a shutter bulb setting are the only two adjustments.  I was happy with a few of the twelve exposures and I love the look of film!"

This was were we started searching.The website it self looks fake and the links to the different accommodations were all very similar with only different names.From the looks of this website the island was ran by spam!Only later did we find out that government website and it's accommodation listings were ran by a third party contractor...

All currency is in AUD. We decided to confirm with motel for three weeks and hoped they would be there to pick us up at the airport. "

Once settled in we were off to explore as much of the island as possible in our three weeks.We were able to contract a boat for hire for several days to take us anywhere in the lagoon.Flats fishing was amazing with miles and miles of pristine bonefish habitat.The boatman was able to drop us off on whatever flat we wanted and also took us to Manta Bay to swim with Manta Rays.We were also able to hire a private guide for a few days although this was much more expensive than a standard boat hire."
