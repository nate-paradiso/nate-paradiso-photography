Nate Paradiso Photography Site


Welcome to my new site and portfolio! After years of using costly #crm software like Squarespace for my basic photography portfolio, I decided it was time for a change and build my own website from scratch using #JavaScript, #React, and Netlify.

One of my main goals was to create a site that not only showcased my work but also kept costs to a minimum. Instead of relying on traditional backend setups, I opted for Netlify's #serverless #functions to power my #api requests for the blog. This approach allowed me to store my blog post data in Jsonbin.io and interact with it using serverless functions. Plus, by securely storing environmental variables in Netlify's account, I ensured a safe and reliable setup. I then utilized Cloudinary to store all my visual content.

Another feature was integrating Google scripts. When the contact form is submitted the data is posted directly into a Google Sheet and email. This streamlined process provides a convenient way to organize email data.

With this approach, I've managed to stay within the confines of budget-friendly accounts while maintaining full control over my site's functionality. The only expense I incur is for the custom domain, which I continue to host on Squarespace while pointing it to Netlifyâ€”a simple and straightforward process.
